## Config

* onGetTextarea: This is a callback with the contents of the textarea as the
  first argument and the return value is the HTML. Need to fix this later
  but currently it is only used in markupeditor.

* onSetTextarea: This is a callback that takes HTML and should return the text to set in the textarea.
